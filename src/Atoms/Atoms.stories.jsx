    <blockquote>
      The atoms of our interfaces serve as the foundational building blocks that comprise all our user interfaces.
      <br/>
      These atoms include basic HTML elements like form labels, inputs, buttons,
      and others that canâ€™t be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional.
      <br/>[...]<br/>
      In the context of a pattern library, atoms demonstrate all your base styles at a glance,
      which can be a helpful reference to keep coming back to as you develop and maintain your design system.
